For most of human history, learning meant being near the right person at the right time. You sat by the fire and listened to stories. You watched someone knap a stone or shape metal or heal a wound, and you tried to copy what their hands were doing. Knowledge lived in people and places. If you were born far away from the right people, you simply did not get it.

Books followed by the internet made this change completely. Suddenly you could watch a lecture from a professor across the world, read documentation for any programming language, or follow a tutorial at two in the morning in your bedroom. Forums, videos, blogs, and online courses turned the whole planet into a sort of chaotic, noisy library. If you had the patience to dig, you could teach yourself almost anything.

Even still, compared to what it feels now, learning has been challenging. Now we have AI that completely removes the process of digging information. In the traditional internet search era, to learn, you'd look up one concept, stumble into three unfamiliar ones, and disappear down a rabbit hole. Articles had typos, examples were half-baked, and a single bug could eat an entire weekend because you didn't yet know the shape of the problem. "Bug" used to be a scarier term even a few years back. Building a foundation took time and a lot of frustration.

Now it's different. You can ask a question in plain language and get an explanation, examples, even a fix - right now... We now learn things so much easier and we have gotten used to it that we barely remember how we used to learn.

People talk about Moore's law (most widely used to describe the idea that tech innovation doubles every couple of years) and it used to sound like a clever slogan more than a felt reality. But compare 1990 to 2025. If I'd tried to "learn to code" back then, a trivial bug would've been a brick wall, not a speed bump. Again, your access to expertise depended on who happened to be nearby, what books your library had, and how much patience you could afford. The internet blew that radius open. And AI just took it even further.

So the ceiling moved. Things that would be a lifetime's work to someone can now be done in months. Not because we got smarter, but because the scaffolding around learning multiplied. We not only keep accelerating the rate at which we discover things, but there's a whole army of new generation accelerating its rate of learning that they blast past what took us 10 years to learn in just one or two. Holy shit, Moore's law is real.
