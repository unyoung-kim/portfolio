          Ilya Sutskever claimed, &quot;Data is the fossil fuel of AI.&quot;
          Specifically, internet and web text have been the fuel powering the
          exponential growth of LLMs. While some argue we&apos;re running out of
          data to further train these models, the rapid advancement of LLMs has
          clearly demonstrated the capability of transformers and the empirical
          validity of scaling laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Robotics doesn&apos;t have that luxury. There is no web-scale corpus
          of &quot;doing.&quot; The world isn&apos;t a dataset you can scrape at
          2 a.m. Motion, contact, objects, people - each interaction is
          expensive to witness and even more expensive to record with fidelity.
          Not to mention that physical AI must run small unlike LLMs, which can
          burst from a data center, a robot&apos;s brain often has to live
          on-device.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>So how do we create a fossil fuel for Robotics?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, the field leans on <strong>teleoperation</strong>: a person
          puppeteering a robot while the robot watches and learns. Each robot
          gets, at best, 24 hours a day of potential operation, but people
          fatigue long before that and in practice, robots &quot;fatigue&quot;
          faster because batteries drain, joints heat up, sensors drift,
          maintenance intervenes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we have <strong>simulation</strong>, also known as{" "}
          <strong>digital twins</strong>, that can run 10,000Ã— faster than
          teleoperation with tens of thousands of rollouts in parallel on a GPU.
          We can mirror real robots in virtual space and rehearse them in
          virtual environments. Build the twin, then spawn variations. Systems

          than extracting and processing text separately, ColPali directly
          embeds images of document pages using Vision Language Models,
          capturing both visual and textual information in a unified
          representation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are gaining significant
          popularity among legacy industries such as law, life sciences, and
          finance, where there are massive amounts of unstructured text that are
          multimodal. Gathering insights from these extensive piles of
          documentation previously involved manual searches and insight
          generation from graphs and diagrams, which are extremely
          time-consuming and laborious, even for highly intelligent individuals.
          Companies like Harvey and Hebbia that have recently bagged huge funds
          exemplify how RAG systems can expedite this process by not only
          finding relevant documents but also providing a GPT-like interface
          that directly answers user questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, RAG systems often hallucinate, especially when they fail to
          find relevant answers from the pool of embedded documents. Achieving
          performance from 80% to 100% is extremely challenging but crucial
          especially for vertical use cases where mistakes can be costly and
          unforgiving.
        </p>
        <p>
          While foundational models are often blamed and guardrails built with
          hallucination models (e.g., Lynx) are gaining popularity, the
          importance of embedding strategies and the limitations of multimodal
          embedding are less frequently discussed.

        <p>
          Agentic Embedding is a new AI engineering term that I coined, which
          implies a method of utilizing different prompts or methods to embed
          various types of modalities (e.g., text, tables, graphs, diagrams,
          photos, etc.). While the code serves as a simple demonstration of the
          concept, it also explores the current limitations of traditional OCR
          methods in processing unstructured multimodal documents.

          Anomaly detection problems typically suffer from extreme class
          imbalance: &quot;normal&quot; events dominate, while anomalies (e.g.,
          fraud) are rare but costly to miss. We investigate whether synthetic
          minority data augmentation improves supervised fraud detection. Using
          the public credit-card transactions dataset (features V1â€“V28, Time,
          Amount; label Class), we compare (i) baseline Logistic Regression and
          (ii) Isolation Forest, then evaluate two augmentation strategiesâ€”SMOTE
          and CTGANâ€”applied only to the training set to avoid leakage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our primary objective is to increase recall on the minority class
          (fraud) while maintaining reasonable precision. CTGAN augmentation
          increases minority recall from 0.71 (baseline) to up to 0.85 (with
          100% synthetic anomalies relative to the original dataset), with
          modest precision trade-offs and an overall F1 improvement (e.g., from
          0.79 â†’ 0.83 at ~5â€“10% synthetic anomalies). We outline implications
          for blockchain anomaly detection and discuss best practices for robust
          evaluation under heavy imbalance.

          points and Recall by ~8â€“14 points, with precision remaining reasonable
          (0.82â€“0.87). Gains are consistent across sample ratios from ~5% to
          100%, with a sweet spot around 10â€“20% where recall rises and precision
          is still strong. Metric variance is expected due to the small number
          of positives in the test set; repeated runs/stratified splits are
          advised.

        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">8. Discussion</h3>
        <p>
          CTGAN better captures complex minority structure than linear
          interpolation (SMOTE), expanding the decision boundary where it
          matters. It substantially boosts recall without collapsing precision.
          Guard against generator artifacts with realism checks (TSTR/TSNR,
          nearest-neighbor distances, UMAP visualization).

          separate real vs synthetic.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">11. Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          On an imbalanced credit-card dataset, CTGAN-based minority
          augmentation consistently improves recall and F1 over a strong
          logistic baseline while keeping precision highâ€”unlike SMOTE, which
          induces excessive false positives. With careful temporal validation,
          threshold selection, and realism checks, this approach is promising
          for blockchain anomaly detection, where labeled anomalies are scarce
          and heterogeneous.

        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          Traditional workout tracking solutions rely on expensive wearables,
          external sensors, or manual countingâ€”all of which present barriers to
          accessibility and user engagement. We wanted to build a solution that
          could accurately track exercise performance using just a smartphone
          camera, making fitness tracking accessible to everyone without
          additional hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a learning perspective, we were excited to explore the challenge
          of fitting machine learning models into resource-constrained mobile
          devices and understand the performance trade-offs involved in
          on-device inference. This project gave us hands-on experience with
          optimizing ML models for real-time execution on consumer hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
          Functionally, we aimed to go beyond simple rep counting. GymPT tracks
          exercise <strong>form quality</strong> in real-timeâ€”if your form is
          incorrect (e.g., insufficient squat depth, improper elbow position),
          the system won&apos;t count the repetition. This ensures users not
          only track their workouts but also maintain proper technique to
          prevent injury and maximize effectiveness.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">
          Technical Implementation
        </h3>
        <p>
          We built a full-stack mobile app using <strong>React Native</strong>{" "}
          and <strong>TensorFlow.js</strong> that performs real-time pose
          estimation entirely on-device. The system uses computer vision to
          detect and track key body joints (shoulders, elbows, hips, knees,
          etc.) through the phone&apos;s camera, eliminating the need for
          external sensors or wearables.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the core of our solution is a <strong>joint-angle tracking</strong>{" "}
          system that monitors the angles between connected joints in real-time.
          We designed a simple yet effective <strong>state machine</strong> over
          these joint-angle features to detect exercise phase changes (e.g., the
          &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; phases of a squat or bicep curl)
          and automatically count repetitions. This state machine approach helps
          debounce miscounts and ensures accurate tracking across different
          exercise types.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">Performance & Results</h3>
        <p>
          Through careful optimization, we achieved impressive on-device
          performance:

            <strong>~96% rep-count accuracy</strong> across common lifts
            including squats, bicep curls, and shoulder presses
          </li>
          <li>
            Real-time feedback with minimal latency, providing instant visual
            cues to users
